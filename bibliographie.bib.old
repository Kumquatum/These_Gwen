abstract = {Evidence has accumulated that adult hematopoietic tissues and other organs contain a population of dormant stem cells (SCs) that are more primitive than other, already restricted, monopotent tissue-committed SCs (TCSCs). These observations raise several questions, such as the developmental origin of these cells, their true pluripotent or multipotent nature, which surface markers they express, how they can be efficiently isolated from adult tissues, and what role they play in the adult organism. The phenotype of these cells and expression of some genes characteristic of embryonic SCs, epiblast SCs, and primordial germ cells suggests their early-embryonic deposition in developing tissues as precursors of adult SCs. In this review, we will critically discuss all these questions and the concept that small dormant SCs related to migratory primordial germ cells, described as very small embryonic-like SCs, are deposited during embryogenesis in bone marrow and other organs as a backup population for adult tissue-committed SCs and are involved in several processes related to tissue or organ rejuvenation, aging, and cancerogenesis. The most recent results on successful ex vivo expansion of human very small embryonic-like SC in chemically defined media free from feeder-layer cells open up new and exciting possibilities for their application in regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {Aging is the inevitable time-dependent decline in physiological organ function and is a major risk factor for cancer development. Due to advances in health care, hygiene control and food availability, life expectancy is increasing and the population in most developed countries is shifting to an increasing proportion of people at a cancer susceptible age. Mechanisms of aging are also found to occur in carcinogenesis, albeit with shared or divergent end-results. It is now clear that aging and cancer development either share or diverge in several disease mechanisms. Such mechanisms include the role of genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic changes, loss of proteostasis, decreased nutrient sensing and altered metabolism, but also cellular senescence and stem cell function. Cancer cells and aged cells are also fundamentally opposite, as cancer cells can be thought of as hyperactive cells with advantageous mutations, rapid cell division and increased energy consumption, while aged cells are hypoactive with accumulated disadvantageous mutations, cell division inability and a decreased ability for energy production and consumption. Nonetheless, aging and cancer are tightly interconnected and many of the same strategies and drugs may be used to target both, while in other cases antagonistic pleiotrophy come into effect and inhibition of one can be the activation of the other. Cancer can be considered an aging disease, though the shared mechanisms underpinning the two processes remain unclear. Better understanding of the shared and divergent pathways of aging and cancer is needed.},

abstract = {A challenge of next generation sequencing is read contamination. We use Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets and technical metadata along with RNA-seq datasets from other studies to understand factors that contribute to contamination. Here we report, of 48 analyzed tissues in GTEx, 26 have variant co-expression clusters of four highly expressed and pancreas-enriched genes (PRSS1, PNLIP, CLPS, and/or CELA3A). Fourteen additional highly expressed genes from other tissues also indicate contamination. Sample contamination is strongly associated with a sample being sequenced on the same day as a tissue that natively expresses those genes. Discrepant SNPs across four contaminating genes validate the contamination. Low-level contamination affects {\~{}}40{\%} of samples and leads to numerous eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 18 genes. This type of contamination occurs widely, impacting bulk and single cell (scRNA-seq) data set analysis. In conclusion, highly expressed, tissue-enriched genes basally contaminate GTEx and other datasets impacting analyses.},

abstract = {Background: Gene co-expression networks capture diverse biological relationships between genes, and are important tools in predicting gene function and understanding disease mechanisms. Functional interactions between genes have not been fully characterized for most organisms, and therefore reconstruction of gene co-expression networks has been of common interest in a variety of settings. However, methods routinely used for reconstruction of gene co-expression networks do not account for confounding artifacts known to affect high dimensional gene expression measurements. Results: In this study, we show that artifacts such as batch effects in gene expression data confound commonly used network reconstruction algorithms. Both theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that removing the effects of top principal components from gene expression measurements prior to network inference can reduce false discoveries, especially when well annotated technical covariates are not available. Using expression data from the GTEx project in multiple tissues and hundreds of individuals, we show that this latent factor residualization approach often reduces false discoveries in the reconstructed networks. Conclusion: Network reconstruction is susceptible to confounders that affect measurements of gene expression. Even controlling for major individual known technical covariates fails to fully eliminate confounding variation from the data. In studies where a wide range of annotated technical factors are measured and available, correcting gene expression data with multiple covariates can also improve network reconstruction, but such extensive annotations are not always available. Our study shows that principal component correction, which does not depend on study design or annotation of all relevant confounders, removes patterns of artifactual variation and improves network reconstruction in both simulated data, and gene expression data from GTEx project. We have implemented our PC correction approach in the Bioconductor package sva which can be used prior to network reconstruction with a range of methods.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to provide an overview of the genetics of human ageing to gain novel insights about the mechanisms involved. By incorporating findings from model organisms to humans, such as mutations that either delay or accelerate ageing in mice, we constructed the gene networks previously related to ageing: namely, the network related to DNA metabolism and the network involving the GH/IGF-1 axis. Gathering data about the interacting partners of these proteins allowed us to suggest the involvement in ageing of a number of proteins through a "guilt-by-association" methodology. To organize our data, we developed the first curated database of genes related to human ageing: GenAge. With over 200 entries, GenAge may serve as a reference database of genes related to human ageing. Moreover, we rendered the first proteomic network map of human ageing, which suggests a relationship between the genetics of development and the genetics of ageing. Our work serves as a framework upon which a systems-biology understanding of ageing can be developed.

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that mammalian aging is marked by increased gene transcriptional variation. This trend was shown not only by studying gene expression in single cells (Bahar et al. 2006), but at the coarse tissue resolution as well (Somel et al. 2006; Li et al. 2009). These led us to believe that looking at absolute changes in expression level alone may not tell the whole story of transcriptional changes in age. Instead the story may be in the more subtle changes in the coordination of expression among multiple genes. For this reason, we decided to look at changes in co-expression relationships with age. To this end, we developed a methodology for differential co-expression network analysis for the comparison gene co-expression on a global scale. We applied this methodology to compare co-expression between young (16-month) and old (24-month) mice. This allowed us to find both gene groups whose coordination appear to be affected by age and to propose potential mechanisms for the change. We believe our work is of broad importance because it represents a different paradigm for looking not only at aging but also at any complex condition or disease{\^{a}}‚Ç¨‚Äùaway from changes in individual genes towards changes in gene relationships.},

abstract = {Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

abstract = {KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; https://www.kegg.jp/ or https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is a reference knowledge base for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call 'network variants' in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.},

abstract = {WikiPathways (wikipathways.org) captures the collective knowledge represented in biological pathways. By providing a database in a curated, machine readable way, omics data analysis and visualization is enabled. WikiPathways and other pathway databases are used to analyze experimental data by research groups in many fields. Due to the open and collaborative nature of the WikiPathways platform, our content keeps growing and is getting more accurate, making WikiPathways a reliable and rich pathway database. Previously, however, the focus was primarily on genes and proteins, leaving many metabolites with only limited annotation. Recent curation efforts focused on improving the annotation of metabolism and metabolic pathways by associating unmapped metabolites with database identifiers and providing more detailed interaction knowledge. Here, we report the outcomes of the continued growth and curation efforts, such as a doubling of the number of annotated metabolite nodes in WikiPathways. Furthermore, we introduce an OpenAPI documentation of our web services and the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) annotation of resources to increase the interoperability of the knowledge encoded in these pathways and experimental omics data. New search options, monthly downloads, more links to metabolite databases, and new portals make pathway knowledge more effortlessly accessible to individual researchers and research communities.},

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for 'soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the 'weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its 'unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set. Copyright {\textcopyright}2005 by the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As the proportion of the ageing population in industrialized countries continues to increase, the dermatological concerns of the aged grow in medical importance. Intrinsic structural changes occur as a natural consequence of ageing and are genetically determined. The rate of ageing is significantly different among different populations, as well as among different anatomical sites even within a single individual. The intrinsic rate of skin ageing in any individual can also be dramatically influenced by personal and environmental factors, particularly the amount of exposure to ultraviolet light. Photodamage, which considerably accelerates the visible ageing of skin, also greatly increases the risk of cutaneous neoplasms. As the population ages, dermatological focus must shift from ameliorating the cosmetic consequences of skin ageing to decreasing the genuine morbidity associated with problems of the ageing skin. A better understanding of both the intrinsic and extrinsic influences on the ageing of the skin, as well as distinguishing the retractable aspects of cutaneous ageing (primarily hormonal and lifestyle influences) from the irretractable (primarily intrinsic ageing), is crucial to this endeavour.},

abstract = {Human skin, like all other organs, undergoes chronological aging. In addition, unlike other organs, skin is in direct contact with the environment and therefore undergoes aging as a consequence of environmental damage. The primary environmental factor that causes human skin aging is UV irradiation from the sun. This sun-induced skin aging (photoaging), like chronological aging, is a cumulative process. However, unlike chronological aging, which depends on the passage of time per se, photoaging depends primarily on the degree of sun exposure and skin pigment. Individuals who have outdoor lifestyles, live in sunny climates, and are lightly pigmented will experience the greatest degree of photoaging. During the last decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms that bring about chronological aging and photoaging. This emerging information reveals that chronological aging and photoaging share fundamental molecular pathways. These new insights regarding convergence of the molecular basis of chronological aging and photoaging provide exciting new opportunities for the development of new anti-aging therapies. This article reviews our current understanding and presents new data about the molecular pathways that mediate skin damage by UV irradiation and by the passage of time.},

abstract = {To understand the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression, the GTEx Consortium gen- erated RNA-seq expression data for more than thirty distinct human tissues. This data pro- vides an opportunity for deriving shared and tissue specific gene regulatory networks on the basis of co-expression between genes. However, a small number of samples are available for amajority of the tissues, and therefore statistical inference of networks in this setting is highly underpowered. To address this problem, we infer tissue-specific gene co-expression networks for 35 tissues in the GTEx dataset using a novel algorithm, GNAT, that uses a hi- erarchy of tissues to share data between related tissues. We show that this transfer learning approach increases the accuracy with which networks are learned. Analysis of these net- works reveals that tissue-specific transcription factors are hubs that preferentially connect to genes with tissue specific functions. Additionally, we observe that genes with tissue-spe- cific functions lie at the peripheries of our networks. We identify numerous modules en- riched for Gene Ontology functions, and show that modules conserved across tissues are especially likely to have functions common to all tissues, while modules that are upregu- lated in a particular tissue are often instrumental to tissue-specific function. Finally, we pro- vide a web tool, available at mostafavilab.stat.ubc.ca/GNAT, which allows exploration of gene function and regulation in a tissue-specific manner.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances that allow faster and cheaper DNA sequencing are now driving biological and medical research. In this review, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms and their applications, including in genome sequencing and resequencing, transcriptional profiling (RNA-Seq) and high-throughput survey of DNA-protein interactions (ChIP-Seq) and of the epigenome. Particularly, we focus on how new methods made possible by NGS can help unravel the biological and genetic mechanisms of aging, longevity and age-related diseases. In the same way, however, NGS platforms open discovery not available before, they also give rise to new challenges, in particular in processing, analyzing and interpreting the data. Bioinformatics and software issues plus statistical difficulties in genome-wide studies are discussed, as well as the use of targeted sequencing to decrease costs and facilitate statistical analyses. Lastly, we discuss a number of methods to gather biological insights from massive amounts of data, such as functional enrichment, transcriptional regulation and network analyses. Although in the fast-moving field of NGS new platforms will soon take center stage, the approaches made possible by NGS will be at the basis of molecular biology, genetics and systems biology for years to come, making them instrumental for research on aging. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
