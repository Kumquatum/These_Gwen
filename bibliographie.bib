Differential co-expression analysis studies diseases and phenotypic variations by finding modules of genes whose co-expression patterns vary across conditions. We review the best practices in gene expression data analysis in terms of analysis of (differential) co-expression, co-expression network, differential networking, and differential connectivity considering both microarray and RNA-seq data along with comparisons. We highlight hurdles in RNA-seq data analysis using methods developed for microarrays. We include discussion of necessary tools for gene expression analysis throughout the paper. In addition, we shed light on scRNA-seq data analysis by including preprocessing and scRNA-seq in co-expression analysis along with useful tools specific to scRNA-seq. To get insights, biological interpretation and functional profiling is included. Finally, we provide guidelines for the analyst, along with research issues and challenges which should be addressed.},

abstract = {Aging human skin undergoes significant morphological and functional changes such as wrinkle formation, reduced wound healing capacity, and altered epidermal barrier function. Besides known age-related alterations like DNA-methylation changes, metabolic adaptations have been recently linked to impaired skin function in elder humans. Understanding of these metabolic adaptations in aged skin is of special interest to devise topical treatments that potentially reverse or alleviate age-dependent skin deterioration and the occurrence of skin disorders. We investigated the global metabolic adaptions in human skin during aging with a combined transcriptomic and metabolomic approach applied to epidermal tissue samples of young and old human volunteers. Our analysis confirmed known age-dependent metabolic alterations, e.g. reduction of coenzyme Q10 levels, and also revealed novel age effects that are seemingly important for skin maintenance. Integration of donor-matched transcriptome and metabolome data highlighted transcriptionally-driven alterations of metabolism during aging such as altered activity in upper glycolysis and glycerolipid biosynthesis or decreased protein and polyamine biosynthesis. Together, we identified several age-dependent metabolic alterations that might affect cellular signaling, epidermal barrier function, and skin structure and morphology. Our study provides a global resource on the metabolic adaptations and its transcriptional regulation during aging of human skin. Thus, it represents a first step towards an understanding of the impact of metabolism on impaired skin function in aged humans and therefore will potentially lead to improved treatments of age related skin disorders.},

abstract = {Plants are fascinating and complex organisms. A comprehensive understanding of the organization, function and evolution of plant genes is essential to disentangle important biological processes and to advance crop engineering and breeding strategies. The ultimate aim in deciphering complex biological processes is the discovery of causal genes and regulatory mechanisms controlling these processes. The recent surge of omics data has opened the door to a system-wide understanding of the flow of biological information underlying complex traits. However, dealing with the corresponding large data sets represents a challenging endeavor that calls for the development of powerful bioinformatics methods. A popular approach is the construction and analysis of gene networks. Such networks are often used for genome-wide representation of the complex functional organization of biological systems. Network based on similarity in gene expression are called (gene) co-expression networks. One of the major application of gene co-expression networks is the functional annotation of unknown genes. Constructing co-expression networks is generally straightforward. In contrast, the resulting network of connected genes can become very complex, which limits its biological interpretation. Several strategies can be employed to enhance the interpretation of the networks. A strategy in coherence with the biological question addressed needs to be established to infer reliable networks. Additional benefits can be gained from network-based strategies using prior knowledge and data integration to further enhance the elucidation of gene regulatory relationships. As a result, biological networks provide many more applications beyond the simple visualization of co-expressed genes. In this study we review the different approaches for co-expression network inference in plants. We analyse integrative genomics strategies used in recent studies that successfully identified candidate genes taking advantage of gene co-expression networks. Additionally, we discuss promising bioinformatics approaches that predict networks for specific purposes.},

abstract = {Co-expression measures are often used to define networks among genes. Mutual information (MI) is often used as a generalized correlation measure. It is not clear how much MI adds beyond standard (robust) correlation measures or regression model based association measures. Further, it is important to assess what transformations of these and other co-expression measures lead to biologically meaningful modules (clusters of genes). We provide a comprehensive comparison between mutual information and several correlation measures in 8 empirical data sets and in simulations. We also study different approaches for transforming an adjacency matrix, e.g. using the topological overlap measure. Overall, we confirm close relationships between MI and correlation in all data sets which reflects the fact that most gene pairs satisfy linear or monotonic relationships. We discuss rare situations when the two measures disagree. We also compare correlation and MI based approaches when it comes to defining co-expression network modules. We show that a robust measure of correlation (the biweight midcorrelation transformed via the topological overlap transformation) leads to modules that are superior to MI based modules and maximal information coefficient (MIC) based modules in terms of gene ontology enrichment. We present a function that relates correlation to mutual information which can be used to approximate the mutual information from the corresponding correlation coefficient. We propose the use of polynomial or spline regression models as an alternative to MI for capturing non-linear relationships between quantitative variables. The biweight midcorrelation outperforms MI in terms of elucidating gene pairwise relationships. Coupled with the topological overlap matrix transformation, it often leads to more significantly enriched co-expression modules. Spline and polynomial networks form attractive alternatives to MI in case of non-linear relationships. Our results indicate that MI networks can safely be replaced by correlation networks when it comes to measuring co-expression relationships in stationary data.},

Although gene co-expression networks typically do not provide information about causality, emerging methods for differential co-expression analysis are enabling the identification of regulatory genes underlying various phenotypes. Here, we introduce and guide researchers through a (differential) co-expression analysis. We provide an overview of methods and tools used to create and analyse co-expression networks constructed from gene expression data, and we explain how these can be used to identify genes with a regulatory role in disease. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of other data types with co-expression networks and offer future perspectives of co-expression analysis.},

Here, we show that the metabolic networks of 43 distinct organisms are organized into many small, highly connected topologic modules that combine in a hierarchical manner into larger, less cohesive units, with their number and degree of clustering following a power law. Within Escherichia coli, the uncovered hierarchical modularity closely overlaps with known metabolic functions. The identified network architecture may be generic to system-level cellular organization.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-seq co-expression analysis is in its infancy and reasonable practices remain poorly defined. We assessed a variety of RNA-seq expression data to determine factors affecting functional connectivity and topology in co-expression networks. RESULTS: We examine RNA-seq co-expression data generated from 1970 RNA-seq samples using a Guilt-By-Association framework, in which genes are assessed for the tendency of co-expression to reflect shared function. Minimal experimental criteria to obtain performance on par with microarrays were {\textgreater}20 samples with read depth {\textgreater}10 M per sample. While the aggregate network constructed shows good performance (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ∼0.71), the dependency on number of experiments used is nearly identical to that present in microarrays, suggesting thousands of samples are required to obtain 'gold-standard' co-expression. We find a major topological difference between RNA-seq and microarray co-expression in the form of low overlaps between hub-like genes from each network due to changes in the correlation of expression noise within each technology.

abstract = {A critical step in the analysis of large genome-wide gene expression datasets is the use of module detection methods to group genes into co-expression modules. Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

abstract = {Obesity is a complex metabolic condition in strong association with various diseases, like type 2 diabetes, resulting in major public health and economic implications. Obesity is the result of environmental and genetic factors and their interactions, including genome-wide genetic interactions. Identification of co-expressed and regulatory genes in RNA extracted from relevant tissues representing lean and obese individuals provides an entry point for the identification of genes and pathways of importance to the development of obesity. The pig, an omnivorous animal, is an excellent model for human obesity, offering the possibility to study in-depth organ-level transcriptomic regulations of obesity, unfeasible in humans. Our aim was to reveal adipose tissue co-expression networks, pathways and transcriptional regulations of obesity using RNA Sequencing based systems biology approaches in a porcine model. We selected 36 animals for RNA Sequencing from a previously created F2 pig population representing three extreme groups based on their predicted genetic risks for obesity. We applied Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to detect clusters of highly co-expressed genes (modules). Additionally, regulator genes were detected using Lemon-Tree algorithms. WGCNA revealed five modules which were strongly correlated with at least one obesity-related phenotype (correlations ranging from -0.54 to 0.72, P {\textless} 0.001). Functional annotation identified pathways enlightening the association between obesity and other diseases, like osteoporosis (osteoclast differentiation, P = 1.4E-7), and immune-related complications (e.g. Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxity, P = 3.8E-5; B cell receptor signaling pathway, P = 7.2E-5). Lemon-Tree identified three potential regulator genes, using confident scores, for the WGCNA module which was associated with osteoclast differentiation: CCR1, MSR1 and SI1 (probability scores respectively 95.30, 62.28, and 34.58). Moreover, detection of differentially connected genes identified various genes previously identified to be associated with obesity in humans and rodents, e.g. CSF1R and MARC2. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply systems biology approaches using porcine adipose tissue RNA-Sequencing data in a genetically characterized porcine model for obesity. We revealed complex networks, pathways, candidate and regulatory genes related to obesity, confirming the complexity of obesity and its association with immune-related disorders and osteoporosis.},

abstract = {Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin with an unknown aetiology. The disease manifests itself as red and silvery scaly plaques distributed over the scalp, lower back and extensor aspects of the limbs. After receiving scant consideration for quite a few years, psoriasis has now become a prominent focus for new drug development. A group of closely connected and differentially co-expressed genes may act in a network and may serve as molecular signatures for an underlying phenotype. A weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), a system biology approach has been utilized for identification of new molecular targets for psoriasis. Gene coexpression relationships were investigated in 58 psoriatic lesional samples resulting in five gene modules, clustered based on the gene coexpression patterns. The coexpression pattern was validated using three psoriatic datasets. 10 highly connected and informative genes from each module was selected and termed as psoriasis specific hub signatures. A random forest based binary classifier built using the expression profiles of signature genes robustly distinguished psoriatic samples from the normal samples in the validation set with an accuracy of 0.95 to 1. These signature genes may serve as potential candidates for biomarker discovery leading to new therapeutic targets. WGCNA, the network based approach has provided an alternative path to mine out key controllers and drivers of psoriasis. The study principle from the current work can be extended to other pathological conditions.},

abstract = {A functional understanding of processes involved in adaptive divergence is one of the awaiting opportunities afforded by high-throughput transcriptomic technologies. Functional analysis of coexpressed genes has succeeded in the biomedical field in identifying key drivers of disease pathways. However, in ecology and evolutionary biology, functional interpretation of transcriptomic data is still limited. Here, we used Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of coexpressed genes in muscle and brain tissue of a lake whitefish backcross progeny. Modules were connected to gradients of known adaptive traits involved in the ecological speciation process between benthic and limnetic ecotypes. Key drivers, that is, hub genes of functional modules related to reproduction, growth, and behavior were identified, and module preservation was assessed in natural populations. Using this approach, we identified modules of coexpressed genes involved in phenotypic divergence and their key drivers, and further identified a module part specifically rewired in the backcross progeny. Functional analysis of transcriptomic data can significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying ecological speciation. Our findings point to bone morphogenetic protein and calcium signaling as common pathways involved in coordinated evolution of trophic behavior, trophic morphology (gill rakers), and reproduction. Results also point to pathways implicating hemoglobins and constitutive stress response (HSP70) governing growth in lake whitefish.},

abstract = {Oxygen plasma treatment of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) thin films produced a hydrophilic surface that was biocompatible and resistant to biofouling in microfluidic studies. Thin film coatings of PDMS were previously developed to provide protection for semiconductor-based microoptical devices from rapid degradation by biofluids. However, the hydrophobic surface of native PDMS induced rapid clogging of microfluidic channels with glial cells. To evaluate the various issues of surface hydrophobicity and chemistry on material biocompatibility, we tested both native and oxidized PDMS (ox-PDMS) coatings as well as bare silicon and hydrophobic alkane and hydrophilic oligoethylene glycol silane monolayer coated under both cell culture and microfluidic studies. For the culture studies, the observed trend was that the hydrophilic surfaces supported cell adhesion and growth, whereas the hydrophobic ones were inhibitive. However, for the fluidic studies, a glass-silicon microfluidic device coated with the hydrophilic ox-PDMS had an unperturbed flow rate over 14 min of operation, whereas the uncoated device suffered a loss in rate of 12{\%}, and the native PDMS coating showed a loss of nearly 40{\%}. Possible protein modification of the surfaces from the culture medium also were examined with adsorbed films of albumin, collagen, and fibrinogen to evaluate their effect on cell adhesion.},

In this work, we investigate the use of data transformations in conjunction with Gaussian mixture models for RNA-seq co-expression analyses, as well as a penalized model selection criterion to select both an appropriate transformation and number of clusters present in the data. This approach has the advantage of accounting for per-cluster correlation structures among samples, which can be quite strong in real RNA-seq data. In addition, it provides a rigorous statistical framework for parameter estimation, an objective assessment of data transformations and number of clusters, and the possibility of performing diagnostic checks on the quality and homogeneity of the identified clusters. We analyze four varied RNA-seq datasets to illustrate the use of transformations and model selection in conjunction with Gaussian mixture models. Finally, we propose an R package coseq (co-expression of RNA-seq data) to facilitate implementation and visualization of the recommended RNA-seq co-expression analyses.},
