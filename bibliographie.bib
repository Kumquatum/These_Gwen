abstract = {Evidence has accumulated that adult hematopoietic tissues and other organs contain a population of dormant stem cells (SCs) that are more primitive than other, already restricted, monopotent tissue-committed SCs (TCSCs). These observations raise several questions, such as the developmental origin of these cells, their true pluripotent or multipotent nature, which surface markers they express, how they can be efficiently isolated from adult tissues, and what role they play in the adult organism. The phenotype of these cells and expression of some genes characteristic of embryonic SCs, epiblast SCs, and primordial germ cells suggests their early-embryonic deposition in developing tissues as precursors of adult SCs. In this review, we will critically discuss all these questions and the concept that small dormant SCs related to migratory primordial germ cells, described as very small embryonic-like SCs, are deposited during embryogenesis in bone marrow and other organs as a backup population for adult tissue-committed SCs and are involved in several processes related to tissue or organ rejuvenation, aging, and cancerogenesis. The most recent results on successful ex vivo expansion of human very small embryonic-like SC in chemically defined media free from feeder-layer cells open up new and exciting possibilities for their application in regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {Aging is the inevitable time-dependent decline in physiological organ function and is a major risk factor for cancer development. Due to advances in health care, hygiene control and food availability, life expectancy is increasing and the population in most developed countries is shifting to an increasing proportion of people at a cancer susceptible age. Mechanisms of aging are also found to occur in carcinogenesis, albeit with shared or divergent end-results. It is now clear that aging and cancer development either share or diverge in several disease mechanisms. Such mechanisms include the role of genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic changes, loss of proteostasis, decreased nutrient sensing and altered metabolism, but also cellular senescence and stem cell function. Cancer cells and aged cells are also fundamentally opposite, as cancer cells can be thought of as hyperactive cells with advantageous mutations, rapid cell division and increased energy consumption, while aged cells are hypoactive with accumulated disadvantageous mutations, cell division inability and a decreased ability for energy production and consumption. Nonetheless, aging and cancer are tightly interconnected and many of the same strategies and drugs may be used to target both, while in other cases antagonistic pleiotrophy come into effect and inhibition of one can be the activation of the other. Cancer can be considered an aging disease, though the shared mechanisms underpinning the two processes remain unclear. Better understanding of the shared and divergent pathways of aging and cancer is needed.},

abstract = {A challenge of next generation sequencing is read contamination. We use Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets and technical metadata along with RNA-seq datasets from other studies to understand factors that contribute to contamination. Here we report, of 48 analyzed tissues in GTEx, 26 have variant co-expression clusters of four highly expressed and pancreas-enriched genes (PRSS1, PNLIP, CLPS, and/or CELA3A). Fourteen additional highly expressed genes from other tissues also indicate contamination. Sample contamination is strongly associated with a sample being sequenced on the same day as a tissue that natively expresses those genes. Discrepant SNPs across four contaminating genes validate the contamination. Low-level contamination affects {\~{}}40{\%} of samples and leads to numerous eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 18 genes. This type of contamination occurs widely, impacting bulk and single cell (scRNA-seq) data set analysis. In conclusion, highly expressed, tissue-enriched genes basally contaminate GTEx and other datasets impacting analyses.},

abstract = {Background: Gene co-expression networks capture diverse biological relationships between genes, and are important tools in predicting gene function and understanding disease mechanisms. Functional interactions between genes have not been fully characterized for most organisms, and therefore reconstruction of gene co-expression networks has been of common interest in a variety of settings. However, methods routinely used for reconstruction of gene co-expression networks do not account for confounding artifacts known to affect high dimensional gene expression measurements. Results: In this study, we show that artifacts such as batch effects in gene expression data confound commonly used network reconstruction algorithms. Both theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that removing the effects of top principal components from gene expression measurements prior to network inference can reduce false discoveries, especially when well annotated technical covariates are not available. Using expression data from the GTEx project in multiple tissues and hundreds of individuals, we show that this latent factor residualization approach often reduces false discoveries in the reconstructed networks. Conclusion: Network reconstruction is susceptible to confounders that affect measurements of gene expression. Even controlling for major individual known technical covariates fails to fully eliminate confounding variation from the data. In studies where a wide range of annotated technical factors are measured and available, correcting gene expression data with multiple covariates can also improve network reconstruction, but such extensive annotations are not always available. Our study shows that principal component correction, which does not depend on study design or annotation of all relevant confounders, removes patterns of artifactual variation and improves network reconstruction in both simulated data, and gene expression data from GTEx project. We have implemented our PC correction approach in the Bioconductor package sva which can be used prior to network reconstruction with a range of methods.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to provide an overview of the genetics of human ageing to gain novel insights about the mechanisms involved. By incorporating findings from model organisms to humans, such as mutations that either delay or accelerate ageing in mice, we constructed the gene networks previously related to ageing: namely, the network related to DNA metabolism and the network involving the GH/IGF-1 axis. Gathering data about the interacting partners of these proteins allowed us to suggest the involvement in ageing of a number of proteins through a "guilt-by-association" methodology. To organize our data, we developed the first curated database of genes related to human ageing: GenAge. With over 200 entries, GenAge may serve as a reference database of genes related to human ageing. Moreover, we rendered the first proteomic network map of human ageing, which suggests a relationship between the genetics of development and the genetics of ageing. Our work serves as a framework upon which a systems-biology understanding of ageing can be developed.
